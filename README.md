This game was to mimic the game play of the famous Space Invader game. 


Some new features are implemented in the physics invader vaersion.


1. Add rigid body physics to the player’s ship and all alien ships.


2. Add a platform to bounce aliens’ ships.


3. Position constrains are set for the alien ships’ rigid body before getting hit. 


4. Player’s missile attack speed is limited. 


5. Player can bounce dead alien ships away before falling to the platform.


6. The particle effects for missile shooting and ship destructions are also set to rigid bodies.


7. Add a random award as a new resource. The random award is generated with some probability when eliminating an alien.  The random award has five possible outcomes:


* 1) bigger missile


* 2) split the missile into three


* 3) one more life


* 4) move quicker


* 5) nothing changes


8. Add a new boss scene. The boss asset was bought on the Unity asset store. It has four attack modes. There are also animators for boss taking damage and death. For each mode, some missiles from some directions will be generated. By shooting at the boss, some random awards can be generated. The boss’s health bar is invisible as in game Monster Hunter.
